***DISCLAIMER***: *Results data in this API are from https://www.euro-millions.com website HTML directly. The data is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as financial or other advice. Nothing contained on this API constitutes a solicitation, recommendation, endorsement, or offer to buy Euromillions tickets. This API is not affiliated in any kind to any Euromillions contest.*

A small REST API for Euromillions contest. Here you will find all results since 2004 and some statistics/analytics.

This was done due to the lack of a way to get this data easily. As this information is of public knowledge, institutions should provide an API for it.
Meanwhile, with these endpoints, the community can build amazing products around the Euromillions context, either a mobile app or a web app.

My goal will also be to build a web app to allow to generate numbers to play based on statistics/analytics.
